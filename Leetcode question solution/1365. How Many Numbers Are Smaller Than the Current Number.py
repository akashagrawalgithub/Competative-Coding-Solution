# 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

# Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

# Return the answer in an array.

                    count+=1
            ans.append(count)
